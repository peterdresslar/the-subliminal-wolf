# *Based in part on a course notebook supplied by J. Applegate.*
# 
# This week, one of our readings was _The Subliminal Man_, a short story by J. G. Ballard. In that book, we are treated to a vision of a dystopic future society. The protagonist, Hathaway finds himself beset by endless advertisements that seem to come literally through the air to persuade every member of society to purchase more and more of everything. The messages are so pervasive and effective that the people in Hathaway's life don't even realize that they are losing control. 
# 
# In other words, think *Invasion of the Body Snatchers*, except Donald Sutherland just really hates banner ads.
# 
# The subtext of _The Subliminal Man_ is that decisions about economic interactions---economic agency---is in danger of being completely subverted from individuals by the nefarious forces of corporations and a corrupt, consumerist society.

# 
# We also, this week, received an unrelated (seemingly so, anyway!) practice Python code notebook titled, BoundedSystems. That notebook featured a model system centered on the dynamics of two separate classes sharing the same domain: wolves, and sheep. The system is comprised of paired equations that operate on the populations of the respective predator and prey, with the resulting system evoking the form of the Lotka-Volterra Model. The following cell contains the description of the Lotka-Voltera Model, quoted directly from the BoundedSystems notebook:
# 
# 

# > #### The Lotka-Volterra Model
# > is a pair of first order, non-linear, differential equations often used to describe the dynamics of biological systems in which two species interact, one a predator and the other its prey. The model was proposed independently by Alfred J. Lotka in 1925 and
# > Vito Volterra in 1926. Considering sheep as the prey and wolves as the predators,  
# >  let $s$ = number of sheep  
# >  $w$ is number of wolves  
# >  $\alpha$ is natural growth rate of sheep  
# >  $\beta$ is death rate of sheep due to wolf predation  
# >  $\gamma$ is natural death rate of wolves  
# >  $\delta$ is how many sheep eaten creates a new wolf.   
# > The system of equations is
# $$\frac{ds}{dt} = \alpha s - \beta s w$$
# $$\frac{dw}{dt} = -\gamma w + \delta \beta s w$$
# 
# > and $x$ is the state vector $[s, w]$ giving sheep and wolf populations.  (1)

# 
# 
# As I mulled our reading list, I was struck by a surprising connection between the story and the model. The model is built with smooth continuous functions describing the growth and retreat of wolf populations. The reason the model can describe these phenomena with perfect predictable curves is: the sheep and wolves in the model, as in real life, have no meaningful economic agency. 
# 
# The wolf does not *choose* to eat a sheep. It does not consider whether losing another sheep today might tip the balance of the ecosystem and lead to eventual extinction. If there's a sheep in front of the wolf, the wolf will just try to get it. Again, wolves effectively have no agency in terms of consumption decisions.
# 
# When we think about it, this is quite similar to the future that Ballard presages. When he writes: "We've no real freedom of choice, anyway," Ballard is describing a situation where individuals have lost their agency over what they purchase. Or, put another way, they have agency, but the force controlling that agency always tilts the shopping purchases toward "buy." 
# 
# Ballard's consumers are Lotka-Volterra wolves.
# 
# <p align="center">üê∫ üê∫ üê∫</p>

# Since this discussion is rooted in the domain of complexity economics, it seems like a useful experiment to give our wolves their Ballardian behavior.
# 
# The wolves have choices about what they eat, except that mutton is the only thing on the menu. And, they are effectively infinitely hungry. Of course, we realize that this is not fully representative in the real world: there are limits to how much sheep meat wolves can fit into their fluffy, rumbly tummies. 
# 
# However, in a model (as opposed to the continuous functions in equations) we must have some kind of quantization, some kind of stepping function to generate an outcome. So, for our model, we can suppose that it is always dinner time: the steps correspond to how long it takes for a wolf to get hungry after a meal. It's an arbitrary call, but actually serves to nudge our computer program a bit toward reality.
# 
# For starters, we can simply apply the same general population functions as we saw in our Lotka-Volterra model. All the systemic variables should work the same way, though the model parameter $\beta$ now turns into a very simple proxy for "here's how often a wolf can get sheep." 
# 
# With this approach, instead of computing the whole timespan at once, we *process cause and effect from start to finish*.

# Let's take a step back. For those who are in our class and have completed the BoundedSystems assignment, the curves above immediately look familiar. (Just in case, I'll point out that the assignment was to toggle beta to .5: you'll need to switch back to .1 for the plot above to make sense.)
# 
# Here's a snapshot of the original notebook assignment for those who are not in the class and are just reading this far because they like math (or wolves, or Ballard):
# 
# <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peterdresslar/the-subliminal-wolf/main/output1.png" width="250">
# 
# Seems like the same graph! However, when we compare the two, we are looking at curves that are in reality totally different from one another. Our plot from the code above is built step by step rather than from the smooth continuous functions. Recognizing base concepts you might remember from calculus class can be pretty satisfying, yes?
# 
# <p align="center">üê∫ üê∫ üê∫</p>

# Let's take our approach a bit further. Thinking back to our Ballard story one more time, I want to explore a little bit more about the connection between those consumers and the wolves? Well, the funny thing about the wolves and sheep model above is that even though there is no real choosing going on, no money, and no pricing function, there _is_ a cost for the wolves. The next sheep they eat is one sheep closer to their extinction. They just don't know, or don't care about the cost: they are _insensitive_ to it. Just like Ballard's consumers:
# 
# > BUY NOW BUY NOW BUY NOW BUY NOW BUY NOW
# > NEW CAR NOW NEW CAR NOW NEW CAR NOW
# > YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES
# 
# (That's an actual quote from the story.)
# 
# <p align="center">&#x2022;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x2022;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x2022;</p>
# 
# Let's take another look at our new step-by-step model. What if we adjust the code so that there is a costing function---sort of a pseudo-price that is based on sheep scarcity? After all, the cost of the next sheep is more or less exactly how many steps losing that sheep takes the wolf toward the grave.
# 
# Let's think it through in an adjusted version of our new model.

# In[41]:


# subliminal wolf model, v0.1.1

import seaborn as sns

gamma = 1.5
delta = .75

# throttle is a simple log output variable.
throttle = 0

# wolves eat every sheep they can. doesn't matter how many there are.
# let's call this sheep-eatiness theta=1.

theta = 1.0

# of course, wolves have a baseline ability to catch and eat sheep, which was neatly captured in our continuous function by beta.
# however, me might assert that that version of beta seems simple because the wolf is completely insensitive to the number of sheep.
# we can reasonably work with an equation that says that wolves will have sensitivity theta to the number of sheep,
# and that sensitivity combines with a base ability (beta0) to create a new beta.

# to create a sheep scarcity factor, let's do some fiddling with our initial number of wolves and sheep (otherwise things could be nonsensical).
# the output of the function will be a "produced" beta.

def process_beta(x, theta, x_0):
    # again let's unpack our sheep and wolves from x
    s, w = x
    # and let's unpack our initial number of sheep and wolves from x_0
    s_0, w_0 = x_0
    # let's go ahead and set our base ability to eat sheep, just like before
    beta0 = 0.1
    # and now let's set a cost function that will make sheep eating more expensive as the number of sheep decreases (relatively)
    k = 1 # a base cost
    eps = 1e-6 # a small number to avoid division by zero
    # the following is a mangled inverted price elasticity of supply function from Khan Academy.
    # cursor then helped me fix the division by zero errors. not a proud set of moments.
    p = k * (s_0 / (s + eps)) # the cost
    # and then we see how this cost changes the beta
    # except, with wolves, theta is one, and they totally ignore the cost. 
    beta = beta0 * (1 / (1 + (1-theta) * p))

    # if you set theta between 0 and 1, wolves will start to care about the cost.
    # note that if you set theta to 0, beta will be 0.

# It's the same plot, right? But really, it isn't. With this version, there's a cost buried in the numbers, and the cost is being completely and egregiously borne by the wolves of each generation (to say nothing of the sheep!) 
# 
# Here are some thoughts:
# 
# 1. When people are persuaded to purchase things we might say that they are specifically persuaded to ignore the cost. To become insensitive to the cost.
# 
# 2. I used the theta for a reason. Theta sort of *is* motive. It's a really interesting variable. (I guess, anyway: there's a whole class ahead of us.)
# 
# 3. The ecological parallel is pretty obvious, and maybe the single most profound connection between rampant consumerism and out-of-control predation. Either way, I suppose the grass grows back in the end.

# The outcomes above are a bit of a downer, so let's close on something a bit more optimistic. Let's think about the power of choice! Or, at least, the power of cost sensitivity.
# 
# The next version of the model isn't really a version at all: we simply set $\theta$ (theta, for sensitivity) to a more moderate value: 0.5. According to our formulas, this should cause the wolves to predate sheep less and less as they become more scare, and vice-versa. The result is a system in which some order---an equilibrium, of sorts---appears:

# Ballard published *The Subliminal Man* in 1963. Here we are in 2025.
# 
# Somehow his story, brimming with hyperbole as it is, has in many ways been surpassed. Vectors of transmission based on giant towers turned out to be child's play compared to the vast power of a dopamine-generating device everyone carries everywhere in their pockets. Instead of selling us ridiculous iterations of toasters and cars, these devices sell us semi-theoretical financial instruments, party-approved religious tracts, and arbitrage on the data that we ourselves have generated. Most all of us would happily trade this condition for a new fridge every six months.
# 
# It isn't that our culture is *drowning* in consumer messaging---instead, each atomic building block of society now features a new fundamental particle called "sponsored content."
# 
# And, sure enough, the sheep are disappearing. (Actually, the sheep are probably fine, but there are plenty of species that are vanishing into the zero-like foam at the bottom margins of our charts.)
# 
# Yet as we consider our seemingly crushing position today, maybe we can take a lesson from our wolves. Sure, we can consider any number of systemic changes: advertising restrictions, consumer constraints, bans on unfavorable goods or services. We can divest or revest or whatever to TikTok. But in the end, the only thing that reliably saves our wolves from their peril is for the wolves themselves to wake up, to observe, and to change their behavior. For themselves, by themselves.
# 
# On that note, I'd like to close by mentioning how enthusiastic I am about the potential of complexity economics---of first-rate simulations grounded by milennia of ordered observations, unleashed by magic-like technology---to at least light us telltales in the right directions.
