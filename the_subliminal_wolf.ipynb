The protagonist, Hathaway finds himself beset by endless advertisements that seem to come literally through the air to persuade every member of society to purchase more and more of everything. The messages are so pervasive and effective that the people in Hathaway's life don't even realize that they are losing control. \n",

That notebook featured a model system centered on the dynamics of two separate classes sharing the same domain: wolves, and sheep. The system is comprised of paired equations that operate on the populations of the respective predator and prey, with the resulting system evoking the form of the Lotka-Volterra Model.

The model is built with smooth continuous functions describing the growth and retreat of wolf populations. The reason the model can describe these phenomena with perfect predictable curves is: the sheep and wolves in the model, as in real life, have no meaningful economic agency. \n",
