## About

This notebook explores the relationship between economic agency and predator-prey dynamics, using wolves and sheep as metaphors for economic actors. The model is derived from the classic Lotka-Volterra equations, with modifications to explore behavioral economics concepts.

The notebook herein is derived from a notebook-based course material by J. M. Applegate of Arizona State University.

For academic references and detailed discussion of the model's derivation, please see the references section within the notebook itself.
